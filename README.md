# Bash Shell Libraries

This new Bash Shell Libraries collection upgrades the Shell Functions
e-book \[FIND A LINK\]. To
support many development needs, here the focus shifts to managing
separate libraries supporting those various needs.

At bottom, it recognizes three needs of a Shell developer independent
of their own application development families.

- backing up functions, libraries, and ancillary files: images,
  spreadsheets, ...
- converting function libraries, their collections, into Apps
- producing a library/function data base, it uses the Unix Relational
  Data Base
