# Using the Markdown Editor

Here is the [Table of Contents](./Development.html).

Anyone hosting a site with lots of documentation, especially in
development, should be using Markdown for their editing
technology. There are many places to start. I'd suggest three:

Feel free to follow any of these. First a brief introduction to what you'll see

-    Wikipedia's [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
     page: *The first Markdown Online practice with a Minimalist
     Online Markdown Editor*

-   Wikipedia, defines Markdown as a [lightweight markup
    language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language)
    ...  inspired by pre-existing conventions for marking up plain
    text in email and Usenet posts. The next item links to the origin
    of the feature in a user-friendly manner

-   The First Markdown, also discovered in the Wikipedia article points
    the "Guber Paper" from March '04 when he released the first HTML
    formater, the idea being

> the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and
> easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally
> valid XHTML (or HTML)." Its key design goal was readability, that the
> language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up
> with tags or formatting instructions,\[9\], unlike text formatted with
> 'heavier' markup languages...
